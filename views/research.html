    <p>
      This paper is an engineering and empirical research paper. The authors, researchers from Gautam Buddha University, study how to process complex natural language queries and minimize ambiguity by using set of production rules and data dictionary which consists of semantics sets for relations and attributes. They explain the process of converting a natural language sentence into a SQL query through a series of steps that include lowercase conversion, tokenization, removal of escape words (words that have significance in SQL), part of speech tagging (categorizing words as nouns, pronouns, or verbs), classification of elements (putting the tokens into relations, attributes and clauses), removal of ambiguous attributes, and finally building of the query itself. The authors also discuss the results of testing their prototype and compare them with the results of an older NLIDBS. However, they do not provide any information about the older NLIDBS and the results generated for it. They also fail to clearly state what exactly their hypothesis is and what they are testing. This paper will be helpful in understanding the implementations of an NLIDBS, but there seems to be no clear evidence of the unique contribution to the field brought forward by this paper.

    <p>I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/Bovojon/AIML-test-app">Chatbot</a> using AIML-Python by following this amazing online <a href="http://www.devdungeon.com/content/ai-chat-bot-python-aiml" target="_blank">tutorial</a>. AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) is an XML-compliant language used for creating or customizing an Alicebot. I will be customizing and adding more functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/Bovojon/AIML-test-app">Chatbot</a> overtime.</p>

    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><b>Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB)</b></h4>
    <p>I am curious to learn how Natural Language Processing can be applied to the process of interacting with databases – SQL and NoSQL. One of goals for this research project is to learn how SQL can be democratized so that relational databases can be written to and queried in natural language. I can see huge potential in such systems where one can query a database system using natural language - they can create accessibility to a lot of people with no SQL backgrounds. This idea was inspired by Salesforce's WikiSQL, which generates structured queries from natural language using Reinforcement Learning.</p>

    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><b>Word2vec</b></h4>
    <p>I was inspired by Google’s RankBrain – a Machine Learning system to embed vast amounts of natural language into mathematical vectors that the computer can understand. Google also produced the word2vec tool for computing continuous distributed representations of words. The goal of this research idea is to study how Natural Language Processing techniques compare in improving the results for a given search query.</p>

    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><b>BlockChain Technology</b></h4>
    <p>BlockChain has been gaining much traction in the past few years, especially with the meteoric rise of the digital payment system, bitcoin. I am motivated to investigate the idea of assigning a digital identifier to every asset, but at this point in time I plan to study the BlockChain technology in its entirety and learn about the academic research that already exists on cryptocurrency and digital payment systems.</p>
