    <p><span class="display-field">Singh, Garima, and Arun Solanki. "An algorithm to transform natural language into SQL queries for relational databases." Selforganizology 3.3 (2016): 110-126.</span></p>
    <p>
      This paper is an engineering and empirical research paper. The authors, researchers from Gautam Buddha University, study how to process complex natural language queries and minimize ambiguity by using set of production rules and data dictionary which consists of semantics sets for relations and attributes. They explain the process of converting a natural language sentence into a SQL query through a series of steps that include lowercase conversion, tokenization, removal of escape words (words that have significance in SQL), part of speech tagging (categorizing words as nouns, pronouns, or verbs), classification of elements (putting the tokens into relations, attributes and clauses), removal of ambiguous attributes, and finally building of the query itself. The authors also discuss the results of testing their prototype and compare them with the results of an older NLIDBS. However, they do not provide any information about the older NLIDBS and the results generated for it. They also fail to clearly state what exactly their hypothesis is and what they are testing. This paper will be helpful in understanding the implementations of an NLIDBS, but there seems to be no clear evidence of the unique contribution to the field brought forward by this paper.

    <p>I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/Bovojon/AIML-test-app">Chatbot</a> using AIML-Python by following this amazing online <a href="http://www.devdungeon.com/content/ai-chat-bot-python-aiml" target="_blank">tutorial</a>. AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) is an XML-compliant language used for creating or customizing an Alicebot. I will be customizing and adding more functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/Bovojon/AIML-test-app">Chatbot</a> overtime.</p>

    <h4 class="w3-text-teal" style="margin-bottom:30px;">Introduction of ideas</h4>
    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><b>Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB)</b></h4>
    <p>I am curious to learn how AI can be used to democratize SQL so databases can be queried in natural language. Salesforce's WikiSQL, which generates structured queries from natural language using Reinforcement Learning, inspired me to learn more about NLIDB systems. I can see huge potential in such systems where one can query a database system using natural language - they can create accessibility to a lot of people with no SQL backgrounds.</p>

    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><b>Graph Theory and Social Networks</b></h4>
    <p>I am interested to learn more about the graph connectivity of crowds and the factors that can improve the connectivity of a crowd.</p>
    <p>I found a great textbook to read on the Mathematics behind the graphs of social networks; it's called <strong style="font-weight:900px;">Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World</strong> By David Easley and Jon Kleinberg. The textbook studies properties of networks in many aspects of life including voting systems, auctions, stock markets, epidemics, etc. It also has a very good section titled <i>Graph Theory and Social Networks</i> which discusses the Mathematical properties of graphs in social networks. This book is very useful in understanding the graphs behind social networks from a Mathematical perspective and building the foundational knowledge to conduct further research on the factors that affect the connectivity of a dynamic graph.</p>

    <h4 class="w3-opacity"><b>AI and Search Engines</b></h4>
    <p>I was inspired by Google’s RankBrain, which is a Machine Learning system to embed vast amounts of natural language into mathematical vectors that the computer can understand. The core idea behind this is related to Word2vec, which converts words and phrases into vectors and uses the ’embeddings’ in deep learning. I am interested to learn how Machine Learning can be used to improve the search results for a query.</p>
