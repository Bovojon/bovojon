    <p>This is on-going project for which the minimal viable product is a social networking web application for making social requests to specific groups of people – much like craigslist but instead the interested bodies need to be connected on MyStife before any can receive requests from the other. </p>
    <p>I am designing the front-end UI with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, and managing the database, authentication and hosting with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>. </p>
    <p>I first had the idea in the summer of 2012. However, back then I did not have the technical skills to build the full-stack application and so I had only created the front-end. Now that I have developed my back-end development skills, I am in the process of building the complete minimal viable product. </p>
    <p>I have made the github repo for this project private but will release the first version in the near future. </p>

    <p> This was one of the biggest projects that I built while attending the Xtern BootCamp. It is a full-stack note-taking application built on top of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) stack. Users can login to create, delete or update notes that are stored as JSON objects in a MongoDB database. </p>
    <p> When we were taught to build the front-end, we started out building it with plain vanilla JavaScript for the purpose of learning. We then rebuilt it with the aid of jQuery and finally built the final user interface with just <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. It was a great experience because when comparing the amount of time it took to build the front end with plain vanilla JavaScript at first, and then jQuery and later AngularJS, it was fascinating to see how much of the work <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> managed behind the scenes, and how much time and lines of code were saved! It was then that I realized how powerful the model–view–controller (MVC) design pattern really was.</p>
    <p> One of the biggest challenges in building this app was authenticating user logins and encrypting user passwords before storing them in the database. We used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt" target="_blank">bcrypt.js</a> (an optimized bcrypt in JavaScript with zero dependencies) and <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens</a> to securely transmit user data from the client to the server and then store it in the database.

    <p> Schedoole is a scheduling web application for the fictional “Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters” where “mutants” can login to schedule and delete office hours.  </p>
    <p> The clean app that implements user registration, authentication, and routing. The front-end was built with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation.css</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> served as the database and also handled user authentication and password encryption.  Furthermore, Node.js was used to build the node server to interact with firebase and send texts (with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>) and emails (with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mailgun-js" target="_blank">mailgun-js</a>).</p>

    <h6 class="w3-text-teal"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>Dec 2013</h6>
    <p> SpotPark was an Android parking application that located parking spots in malls using data from sensor systems in the malls and displayed the spaces on an outline of the indoor parking areas. A group of friends and I launched the prototype (MVP) at <a href="http://www.businesstoday.net.my/discover-my-apps-for-visit-malaysia-year-2014/" target="_blank">Discover MY Apps Hackathon 2013</a> in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The application was built with Java but I was more engaged in designing the user interface using XML. </p>
