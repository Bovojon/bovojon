      <p>I was a backend Ruby on Rails engineer but also did some work on the frontend with React. Below are some of the projects and stories I worked on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lessonly API v2</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p>Adopted an API First Development approach to build the 2nd version of the Lessonly API using GraphQL.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Bulk User Importing</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p> Fixed issues with uploading user CSV files in bulk due to hidden BOMs (byte order marks) and extra columns in the files. <br><br>Implemented automatic statistical calculations of data for groups of users after a bulk user import.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Web Security</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p> Used Pundit Policy Scopes to prevent references to internal implementation objects in the Lessonly database from being exposed to users without validation mechanisms, thereby preventing IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) attacks. <br><br> Fixed a bug that let users’ password reset codes be leaked to third-party sites through the referer header, thereby preventing possibilities for account takeovers.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Chrome Extension and Web Widget</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p>Improved the functionality of an endpoint to discern between lessons and resources in the database. <br><br> Fixed a bug that resulted from passing nil values as parameters to the endpoints.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Exporting User Reports</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p>Added an additional option to the existing feature to let users export reports with custom user field values. <br><br> Fixed issues with exporting reports that contained empty columns and data fields with special characters.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Default Landing Page Options</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p>Built a setting in ActiveAdmin to let administrative users choose the default landing page for their learners depending on certain conditions that they specify in the application.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Integration of Third-Party Learning Frameworks into the Lessonly app</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p>Worked on this bigger project as part of a team to let users upload content to Lessonly from other e-learning software products.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Lessons and Courses Organization</li>
        <div class="well well-sm" style="background-color: #ddffdd!important; padding:10px !important;">
          <p>Worked on this bigger project as part of another team to build complex algorithms to let administrative users organize their lessons and courses effectively for their learners.</p>

      <p>I help design and build sections of Earlham's Website using Umbraco (a CMS that runs on .Net, C#, Razor, and MSSQL). I also use other web frameworks (Rails and MEAN stack) to build internal web applications used by Earlham students and faculty.</p>

      <p>Below are some of the bigger projects I have worked on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created AB and multivariate tests for one of Earlham's promotional web pages using Google Optimize and analyzed the results to improve traffic rate.</li>
        <li>Built a single-page web application (using AngularJs, NodeJs, and Express) for providing information on hosting events on Earlham College venues. The application facilitated the submission of requests to the Events And Operations department. I also implemented project tracking and version control for the project. The final design of the application can be viewed <a href="https://bovojon.github.io/Interactive-form/#/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

      <p> <a href="http://bootcamp16.getfretless.com/" target="_blank">Xtern BootCamp</a>, powered by <a href="http://techpoint.org/" target="_blank">TechPoint</a>, is an intensive 10-week training program focused on software development. </p>
      <p> I learnt to build single-page web applications using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) stack and also underwent Scrum software development training.</p>

      <p> The CS department at Earlham College organizes a number of applied CS groups and <a href="https://epress.earlham.edu/webdev/" target="_blank">WebDev</a> is one of them. The primary aim of the groups is to give students opportunities to apply and extend knowledge gained in the classroom to "real world" software and hardware projects. The WebDev team’s primary responsibilities are the development and maintenance of the department's online presence. </p>
      <p> I was involved in maintaining the layout, structure, and look of Earlham's <a href="https://cs.earlham.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science department's website</a>. We met once weekly and discussed problems, solutions, and new web frameworks that might be helpful in improving the layout and/or functionaity of the site. I  worked with Wordpress and built dynamic and responsive websites using PHP and Bootstrap.</p>

      <p> I worked as a sales assistant at an IT shop, editing images and producing business cards and advertisement leaflets using the Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I also created company websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I am proud of this experience because it was the first time I was employed for my web development skills. </p>
      <p> Through this experience I developed the mind-set of learning through trial and error. I also learnt how to provide friendly customer service to diverse populations and developed the ability to express myself effectively. I believe this job gave me the opportunity to develop my communication and interpersonal skills as I greeted customers and responded to inquiry phone calls. </p></p>
